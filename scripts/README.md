# Task Creation Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help create branches and issues for Tasks 13-21.

## Scripts

### 1. `create_task_branches.sh`

Creates feature branches for all Tasks 13-21.

**Usage:**
```bash
cd /path/to/LightJockey
./scripts/create_task_branches.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Creates branches named `feature/task-{N}-{task-name}` for each task
- Pushes branches to origin
- Skips branches that already exist

**Requirements:**
- Git configured with push access to the repository
- Currently on a branch (will return to it after completion)

### 2. `create_task_issues.py`

Creates GitHub Issues for all Tasks 13-21 using the GitHub API.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install PyGithub

# Run script with your GitHub token
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token python3 scripts/create_task_issues.py
```

**What it does:**
- Creates issues with full task descriptions
- Labels them as `autogenerated`
- Links to the corresponding branch
- Skips issues that already exist

**Requirements:**
- Python 3
- PyGithub package (`pip install PyGithub`)
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

**Getting a GitHub Token:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "LightJockey Task Creation"
4. Select scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Generate and copy the token
6. Use it in the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable

## Task Overview

All tasks (13-21) are documented in detail in:
- `docs/LIGHTJOCKEY_Entwicklungsplan.md` (main development plan)
- `docs/TASKS_13-21_OVERVIEW.md` (quick reference)

## Alternative: Manual Workflow Trigger

You can also use the existing automation workflow:

1. Enable automation: Set repository variable `AUTOMATION_ENABLED` to `true`
2. The workflow `.github/workflows/flow-autotask_01-start.yml` will automatically create issues/PRs for the next uncompleted task
3. Or manually trigger the workflow from GitHub Actions tab

## Notes

- Both scripts check for existing branches/issues to avoid duplicates
- The automation workflow uses the same naming convention
- Task 13 is marked as the current priority in the development plan
