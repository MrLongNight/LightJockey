# Task 15: Advanced Logging & Metrics

## Description

This task focused on enhancing the logging and metrics capabilities of LightJockey. The following features were implemented:

- **Enhanced Serilog Configuration:** The Serilog configuration was updated to include the `SourceContext` in the log output, which provides more detailed and useful information for debugging.
- **Metrics Export:** The `MetricsService` was updated to include the ability to export the metrics history to a CSV file.
- **UI for Metrics:** A new UI was created to display the metrics history and provide a button to export the data.
