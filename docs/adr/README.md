An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or made
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
