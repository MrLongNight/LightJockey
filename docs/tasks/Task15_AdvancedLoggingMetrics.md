# Task 15: Advanced Logging & Metrics

## Description

This task enhances the application's logging and metrics capabilities, providing more detailed insights into its performance and behavior. The key features implemented are:

- **Advanced Serilog Configuration:** The Serilog configuration has been updated to include method name enrichment and a 14-day log retention policy. This provides more detailed and longer-term logging for better debugging and analysis.
- **Metrics Service:** A new `MetricsService` has been introduced to capture and manage a history of performance metrics, including latency and FPS. This service maintains a history of the last 300 data points, allowing for real-time and historical performance analysis.
- **UI Metrics Display:** The application now includes a new "Metrics" tab in the main window, which displays the performance metrics in a series of charts. This provides a visual representation of the application's performance, making it easier to identify and diagnose issues.
