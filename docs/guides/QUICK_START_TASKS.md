# Quick Start: Creating Tasks 13-21

This guide shows you how to quickly set up branches and issues for Tasks 13-21.

## Option 1: Create Everything (Recommended)

Run both scripts to create branches AND issues:

```bash
# 1. Create all branches
./scripts/create_task_branches.sh

# 2. Install PyGithub (if not already installed)
pip install PyGithub

# 3. Create all issues (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your GitHub token)
GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN python3 scripts/create_task_issues.py
```

## Option 2: Use Existing Automation

Enable the existing workflow to auto-create tasks one by one:

1. Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables
2. Create variable `AUTOMATION_ENABLED` with value `true`
3. The workflow will automatically create issues/PRs on each push to main

## Option 3: Manual Creation

Use the task information in `docs/TASKS_13-21_OVERVIEW.md` to manually create issues and PRs in the GitHub UI.

## Getting a GitHub Token

For Option 1, you need a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "LightJockey Task Setup"
4. Select scope: ✅ **repo** (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it in the command above

**Important:** Keep your token secure! Don't commit it to the repository.
